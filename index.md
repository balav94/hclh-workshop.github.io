# High-Precision Computing on Low-Precision Hardware (HCLH)

**Workshop at SC (proposal in progress).**  
This workshop brings together researchers, application scientists, system and library developers, and industry partners to explore approaches that enable high-precision scientific computing to effectively leverage low-precision hardware.

Modern accelerators increasingly favor reduced-precision arithmetic (e.g., FP16/BF16/TF32/FP8) for performance and energy efficiency, while many scientific workloads still require numerical accuracy, stability, and reproducibility. HCLH focuses on algorithms, software, tooling, and community-driven artifacts that help bridge this gap.

## Topics of interest
Submissions may include (but are not limited to):

- Mixed-precision methods with reliability safeguards
- Precision-adaptive and selective refinement strategies
- Precision-extension techniques (e.g., FP64 emulation) and alternative number formats (e.g., posits)
- Analyses and tooling for numerical sensitivity characterization (kernels → full applications)
- Frameworks for reasoning about stability, conditioning, and error propagation
- Compiler/runtime/library support for precision-aware execution and automated precision selection
- Application case studies: fidelity vs. performance vs. energy

See **Call for Papers** for details.

## Expected outcomes
- Peer-reviewed archival publications in the SC workshop proceedings
- Publicly archived talks, presentations, and panel summaries
- An initial community-curated inventory of numerically sensitive kernels/applications and evaluation practices
- A short synthesis of open challenges and research directions
