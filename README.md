# HCLH Workshop Website (GitHub Pages / Jekyll)

This is a starter GitHub Pages site (Option 1: Jekyll) for the workshop:
**High-Precision Computing on Low-Precision Hardware (HCLH)**.

## Quick start (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a GitHub repository named: `YOURNAME.github.io` **or** (recommended for workshops)
   `hclh-workshop.github.io`
2. Upload these files to the repo root.
3. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages**
   - Source: *Deploy from a branch*
   - Branch: `main` (or `master`), Folder: `/ (root)`
4. Wait for Pages to deploy. Your site will appear under the Pages URL.

## Tabs / navigation
Tabs are controlled by `header_pages` in `_config.yml`.

## Customize
- Update the title/description in `_config.yml`
- Replace TBD items (dates, submission link, email alias, invited speakers)
- Edit `assets/proposal.pdf` if you want to host the latest proposal
