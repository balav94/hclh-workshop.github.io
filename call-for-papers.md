# Call for Papers

HCLH solicits contributions on methods, tools, and experiences that enable **accurate, stable, and reproducible** scientific computing on increasingly **low-precision** hardware.

## Intended audience (not exhaustive)
We encourage submissions from simulation-driven communities (e.g., FEM, CFD, multiphysics) and the growing AI-for-science/SciML ecosystem (e.g., surrogate modeling, physics-informed methods), as well as compiler/runtime/library developers and hardware–software co-design researchers.

## Topics
Submissions may include (but are not limited to):

- Techniques, analyses, and tooling for characterizing numerical sensitivity in scientific workloads (kernels, solver pipelines, full simulations)
- Frameworks for reasoning about numerical stability, conditioning, and error propagation
- Mixed-precision algorithms, reliability safeguards, and precision-adaptive methodologies beyond dense linear algebra
- Precision-extension approaches (e.g., FP64 emulation) for general-purpose scalar arithmetic
- Alternative number formats (e.g., posits, unum-inspired representations) in HPC workflows
- Compiler, runtime, and library support for precision-aware execution and automated precision selection
- Application experiences and case studies: numerical fidelity vs. performance/energy

## Submission instructions
**TBD** (will be updated once the workshop is approved and the submission site is live).

For now, please contact the organizers if you want to express interest or propose an invited talk/panel topic.
